Toptal - Event Task Manager

THE BRIEF: Event Task Manager

Design a mobile app that allows event organizers to manage tasks that are coordinated between multiple teams, e.g., caterers, interior decorators, audio-video technicians, lighting engineers, etc. The app design should contain the following minimum functionality: the ability to create and assign new tasks, make requests to another team, raise an alert if a problem occurs, and keep track of the progress for all tasks assigned. Create the app from the general coordinatorâ€™s point of view. We encourage you to incorporate additional features that would elevate this concept to the next level.

We keep this brief intentionally open for interpretation, and we expect to see what you can achieve and how far you can take it. Please share your process and typical approach as a designer and use this as an opportunity to showcase your skills, creativity, and talent. We recommend spending around 8 hours on this challenge. If you are available and want to spend more than 8 hours, feel free to spend longer.
